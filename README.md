# Belajar Data Analytics dengan Python - Dicoding

This project is the final project of data analysis in Python via the Dicoding platform. The project contains stages of data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and Streamlit dashboards for interactive data exploration. This project aims to analyze Bike Sharing Dataset and using streamlit to deploy the app which can be accessed here:
